"""
`_find_all_combinations(vectors)`

Find all possible combinations among the vectors of values. 

**Arguments**
- `vectors`: Vector of vectors representing different value sets.

**Returns**
- `combinations`: Matrix containing all combinations of values from the
    individual vectors. Each row represents one combination.

**Example**
```
julia> vectors = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]];
julia> combinations = find_all_combinations(vectors);
julia> print(combinations);
[1 3 6; 1 4 6; 1 5 6; 2 3 6; 2 4 6; 2 5 6]
```
